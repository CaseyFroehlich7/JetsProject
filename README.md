# Jets Program 

# Description: 

The week 3 homework, Jets, was by far the most challenging yet rewarding projects we've been assigned so far. Having the opportunity to create a fleet of jets, all with different capabilities was a lot of fun. Each jet had its own make, model, speed, range, and purchase price.  I referenced the US Airforce website to obtain real data on active jets that are used today. After I had created my fleet, I needed an air base to store them and thats where the "Sleepy Pilot" air base came into play. With that being said, having a bunch of awesome jets just sitting in an air base isn't any fun, so, I was tasked with creating a user menu where a visitor of Sleepy Pilot could interact with the fleet of jets in a variety of different ways. 

To accomplish this task, it was important to follow the given UML diagram because there were so many moving parts in this project. Working with different classes, interfaces, and a main application required a lot of different methods. A method to list all of the jets, fly the jets, view the fastest jet, view the jet with the longest range, load the cargo into a jet, and finally a method to add and remove a jet from the fleet. These methods were what made the user menu function. The user could flow through each one of these menu options until they decided to quit.

# Lessons Learned:

As I learned from the previous homework project, Food Trucks, it was important for me to take sometime to create an outline or plan of attack for this project. With some many different moving parts I knew that if I dove in and started coding, I would end up with a mess just like I did with Food Trucks. Skill Distillery is unlike anything I've ever experienced before. The pace of the course paired with the amount of information can feel crippling at times. During this project, I realized that the amount of work and focus I was putting in to this program in the first two weeks was simply not enough. It took just about every last minute of this weekend to accomplish this project and it feels extremely rewarding but the lesson learned is I need to do more. With that being said, I definitely learned A LOT more about;
1. Inheritance
2. Polymorphism
3. Abstract classes
4. Array Lists
5 . Casting
6. Instanceof
7. Loop usage
8. Following a UML diagram
9. Interfaces
10. Biggest Lesson Learned: don't hide one, small, space in the middle of your txt file. It'll waste a lot of your time!
